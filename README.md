# eCommerce Transactions Dataset Analysis | Zeotap  - Data Science Assignment

## üìã **Assignment Overview**

This project was completed as part of the **Data Science Assignment** for **Zeotap**, with the goal of analyzing and deriving insights from an eCommerce transactions dataset. The task involved performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and generating insights to understand customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

## üìä **Dataset Overview**

The dataset contains transaction data from an eCommerce platform, with the following key features:

- **Transaction IDs**: Unique identifiers for each purchase.
- **Product Information**: Details of purchased products, including categories.
- **Customer Demographics**: Information about the customers such as age, location, etc.
- **Transaction Timestamps**: Time and date when purchases were made.
- **Purchase Amounts**: Total spent by customers during each transaction.

The objective was to process and analyze this data to extract actionable business insights, identify patterns, and answer relevant questions about customer engagement and sales performance.

## üßë‚Äçüíª **Technologies & Tools Used**

- **Python**: For data cleaning, processing, and analysis.
  - Libraries: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive analysis and visualization.
- **SQL**: For querying the dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: For presenting insights through charts and graphs.

## üîç **Key Tasks & Insights**

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - **Missing Data Handling**: Managed missing or incomplete values through imputation and removal.
   - **Outlier Detection**: Identified and treated outliers in monetary values and transaction times.
   - **Data Normalization**: Standardized time-based data for easier analysis.
   - **Duplication Removal**: Ensured data integrity by removing duplicate records.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Customer Segmentation**: Grouped customers by transaction frequency and spending patterns.
   - **Product Analysis**: Identified top-performing products and categories.
   - **Sales Trends**: Analyzed peak shopping times, day-of-week trends, and seasonal patterns.
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Identified key relationships between customer attributes and transaction behavior.

### 3. **Visualizations**
   - **Histograms**: Displayed the distribution of transaction amounts and purchase frequency.
   - **Bar Charts**: Showed the top-selling products and categories.
   - **Heatmaps**: Visualized correlations between various features such as customer demographics and sales performance.

### 4. **Key Findings**
   - **Top Products**: Identified the most popular products by total sales and frequency.
   - **Peak Times**: Found specific days and times of the week when transactions were highest.
   - **Customer Behavior**: Recognized segments of customers who make high-value purchases and those who are more frequent but low-spending.

### 5. **Recommendations**
   Based on the analysis, I suggest:
   - **Targeted Marketing**: Focus marketing efforts on high-value customer segments.
   - **Optimized Sales Strategies**: Adjust pricing and promotions around peak shopping times.
   - **Inventory Management**: Stock up on high-demand products identified in the analysis.
